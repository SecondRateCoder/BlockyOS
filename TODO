[] Change how data is formatted in RAM:
    [] Optimise RAM usage by storing Context and Data in HeaderMetadata.
    [] Use a more efficient data structure for storing Context and Data.
    [] Define a more space-efficient format for booleans, storing each boolean in a List of bytes, then allowing Applications to access it on a bit-wise level.
    [] Generate a program that will override the conventional memory access in C, for robust Memory protection.
